budgetBuddy
===========

An API for more intuitive access to NYC Budget Data, current and historical

The supporting schedules for each budget contain a treasure trove of data, down to the lowest level.  http://www.nyc.gov/html/omb/downloads/pdf/ss5_14.pdf

These PDFs are raw output from whatever budget system the city uses, and are very well structured making scraping much simpler.

The immediate goal of this project is to scrape current and historical budget docs, move the data into a database, and build an intuitive REST api for querying different facets of the NYC budget.
