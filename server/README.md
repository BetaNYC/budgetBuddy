Getting started
-------------------------

* Install the [latest version of nodejs](http://nodejs.org/)
* Install the dependencies

        npm install

* Launch the API server. (You may need to sudo if your login doesn't have permission to set up a network listener.)

        nodemon server.js
        
* Make queries to the server (by default it listens on port 3000)
