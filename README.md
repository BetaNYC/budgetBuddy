budgetBuddy
===========

An API for more intuitive access to NYC Budget Data, current and historical

The supporting schedules for each budget contain a treasure trove of data, down
to the lowest level.  [http://www.nyc.gov/html/omb/downloads/pdf/ss5_14.pdf][]

These PDFs are raw output from whatever budget system the city uses, and are
very well structured making scraping much simpler.

The immediate goal of this project is to scrape current and historical budget
docs, move the data into a database, and build an intuitive REST api for
querying different facets of the NYC budget.

### How to run the parser

`python parse.py all.txt > data/2015.txt`

You can use the bundled [csv2sqlite3](https://github.com/talos/csv2sqlite3) to
convert the CSV to sqlite.

`python bin/csv2sqlite3.py data/2015.txt`

### Sample queries

Once you've created the local SQLite database, you can run queries on it.

```
    $ sqlite3 data/2015.db
    sqlite> select DESCRIPTION, SUM(value) from out where agency_name = 'DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION' and key = '# POS' and budget_period = 'EXECUTIVE BUDGET FY15' and `inc/dec` is NULL GROUP BY DESCRIPTION;
    description                               SUM(value)
    ----------------------------------------  --------------------
    FULL TIME PEDAGOGICAL PRSONNEL            108959
    FULL YEAR POSITIONS                       10321
    ULL TIME PEDAGOGICAL PRSONNEL             904
    ULL YEAR POSITIONS                        203
```

The Department of Education employs [75,000 teachers](http://schools.nyc.gov/AboutUs/default.htm),
although that count likely doesn't include many "full time pedagogical
personnel".

```
    select sum(value) from out where budget_period = 'EXECUTIVE BUDGET FY15' and `inc/dec` is null and key = 'AMOUNT';
    sum(value)
    ----------------------------------------
    74619472575
```

$74.6 billion is [about where we should be!](http://www.therepublic.com/view/story/fdb1b34d1c6943d4bfcce37b63fb5491/US--NYC-Budget)

```
    sqlite> select agency_name, sum(value) from out where budget_period = 'EXECUTIVE BUDGET FY15' and `inc/dec` is null and key = 'AMOUNT' group by agency_name order by sum(value) DESC LIMIT 20;


    agency_name                               sum(value)

The Department of Education claims a [$24 billion](http://schools.nyc.gov/AboutUs/default.htm)
budget, although a significant portion of that could come from the state and
federal government.

The Department of Social Services had a [$9.3
billion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City_Human_Resources_Administration)
budget in 2013, so $9.6 billion sounds about right.

The Police Department's budget has been in the realm of [$3.6
billion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NYPD), so $4.7 seems a bit excessive.

When querying, make sure to include `budget_period = 'EXECUTIVE BUDGET FY15 and
`inc/dec` IS NULL` in order to query the most recent budget for absolute
numbers, rather than increases/decreases.

You'll also want to limit by `key = '# POS'` if you're looking up employment
counts, `key = 'AMOUNT'` if you're looking up spending, and `key = #CNTRCT`
if you're looking up numbers of contracts.

```
    sqlite> select distinct key from out;
    # POS
    AMOUNT
    # CNTRCT
```

How much does NYC plan to spend on books next year?

```
    sqlite> select sum(value) from out where DESCRIPTION LIKE '%BOOKS%' AND key='AMOUNT' and budget_period = 'EXECUTIVE BUDGET FY15' and `inc/dec` is NULL;
    sum(value)
    ----------------------------------------
    142469594
```

$142M on books!  Who in the city loves to read so much?

```
    sqlite> select agency_name, budget_code_name, description, value from out where DESCRIPTION LIKE '%BOOKS%' AND key='AMOUNT' and budget_period = 'EXECUTIVE BUDGET FY15' and `inc/dec` is NULL order by value desc limit 10;

    agency_name                budget_code_name                     description     value

### Demo Server

You can use the bundled sample server to preview the data in the browser, if
you wish.

```
$ cd tmpserver
$ npm install
$ python ../bin/csv2sqlite3.py ../data/2015.db
$ node server.js
```
